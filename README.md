# Advent of Code 2021

It's Advent of Code time again. I must admit that I feel like I've got a lower tolerance for more grief in life. Losing sleep debugging late night code seems like not much fun. But, I'm gonna get started and see if I pick up steam as I go.

I considered trying to write everything in Swift this year, which would be great learning for me. But, I think I'd find it annoying to have to learn how to re-do all of these things I know I could do in Python in 2 lines of code. See previous paragraph RE: grief.

Like last year, I have a small utility script to stub out a directory for each day, including a basic Python script with support for input args and parsing an input file. It's just a little bit of template code, so I don't have to deal with that every single day.
